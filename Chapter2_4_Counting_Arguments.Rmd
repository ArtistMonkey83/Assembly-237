## Section 2.4 Counting Arguements

This section presents some common methods for counting the number of outcomes in a set.  When there are a lot of outcomes in an experiment, it is convenient to have a method of determining how many outcomes there are in $S$.

<https://media.csuchico.edu/media/Math+350+Chapter+2.4+Multiplication+Rule/1_2eo4z7ze>

**Multiplication rule**:  
Suppose that an experiment has two parts.  In the first part there are $n_{1}$ outcomes and in the second part there are $n_{2}$ outcomes.  The composite experiment which consists of  both parts of the experiment then has $n_{1}\times n_{2}$ possible outcomes.

####Example:  
Let $E_{1}$ denote the selection of a rat form a cage containing one female (F) rat and one male (M) rat.  Let $E_{2}$ denote the administering of either drug A, drug B, or a placebo to the selected rat.

How many possible outcomes are there? 

List the possible outcomes?


Another way of illustrating the multiplication principle is with a *tree diagram*.  The diagram shows that there are $n_{1}$=2 possibilities for the gender of the rat and that for each of these outcomes there are $n_{2}=3$ possibilities for the drug.

The multiplication rule can be extended to more than two experiments.

#### You try it:
Each year starts on one of the seven days (Sunday through Saturday).  Each year is either a leap year (i.e., it includes February 29) or not.  How many different calendars are possible for a year?


#### You try it:
A chemical engineer wishes to observe the effects of temperature, pressure, and catalyst concentration on the yield resulting from a certain reaction.  If she intends to include two different temperatures, three pressures, and two levels of catalyst, how many different runs must she make in order to observe each temperature-pressure catalyst combination exactly twice?



#### You try it:
A restaurant offers a choice of four appetizers, fourteen entrees, six desserts, and five beverages. How many different meals are possible if a diner intends to order only three courses?

```{r}

```

## Proposition 2.2 Combinations

The number of ways of choosing $k$ distinct objects from a set of $n$ is given by
\[
\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!\left(n-k\right)!}.
\]

#### Example

The Alpha Beta Zeta sorority is trying to fill a pledge class of nine new members during fall rush.  Among the twenty-five available candidates, fifteen have been judged marginally acceptable and ten highly desirable.  How many ways can the pledge class be chosen to give a two-to-one ratio of highly desirable to marginally acceptable candidates?

```


## Combinatorial Probability

In the previous section our concern focused on counting the number of ways a given operation, or sequence of operations could be performed.  In this section we want to calculate the probability that a certain combination will occur.  For instance, from the previous section we would be able to count the total number of ways a poker player could draw a straight.  What if the poker player wanted to determine the probability of a straight.  How could we set this up?



#### Example
Ten equally qualified marketing assistants are candidates for promotion to associate buyer; seven are men and three are women.  If the company intends to promote four of the ten at random, what is the probability that exactly two of the four are women?

<https://media.csuchico.edu/media/Math+350+Chapter+2.4+Promotion/1_oi4rp17e>

```{r}
##Total number of ways
total<-choose(10,4)
two_women<-choose(3,2)*choose(7,2)
(prob_two_women<-two_women/total)
```


#### Example
An urn contains twenty chips, numbered 1 through 20.  Two are drawn simultaneously.  What is the probability that the numbers on the two chips will differ by more than 2? Hint:  Calculate the complement and subtract from one.

<https://media.csuchico.edu/media/Math+350+Chapter+2.4+Urns+more+than+2/1_s7qa1tqb>

```{r}



```



#### Example
Consider a set of ten urns, nine of which contain three white chips and three red chips each.  The tenth contains five white chips and one red chip.  An urn is picked at random.  Then a sample of size 3 is drawn without replacement from that urn.  If all three chips drawn are white what is the probability that the urn being sampled is the one with five white chips?
